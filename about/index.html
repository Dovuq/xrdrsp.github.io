        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is the personal website of <a href="/">xrdrsp</a>. The frequency of updating is unpredictable. More contents (e. g. recordings of my piano performance) may in the future be uploaded here, whereas some details are still under consideration.</p>
        <p id="comment">Formerly, you may leave a comment in <a href="../discuss">the Discussion Board</a>, which is now closed. You can directly provide your feedback to <a href="/">me</a> via emails or through any other approaches.</p>
        <p>This website was set up on 2020-01-31. The present version of this website was first published on 2020-11-01. Previously, I used several other blog addresses with public posts, all of which are deemed expired unless specified otherwise. For the posts that have been migrated to this website, those on this website should take precedence. I once built the blog rendered with some blogging systems like <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
        <h2>Technical Remarks</h2>
        <p>This blog is currently using the <a href="/theme.css">Untitled Theme</a> by <a href="https://dovuq.github.io/">Dovuq</a> and me.</p>
        <p><a href="https://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/">Computer Modern</a> and <b>Noto Sans</b> are used as main typefaces. See also <a href="/theme.css">theme.css</a>.</p>
        <p>To show mathematics notation with $\LaTeX$, I embedded MathJax 2.7.9. See also <a href="/head.html">head.html</a>.</p>
        <p>The formatting of the date & time is <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code>. To take one example, 2006-11-20 11:40:00 represents forty past eleven, November 20th in year 2006.</p>

        <h2 id="contact">About Me</h2>
