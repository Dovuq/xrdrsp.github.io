        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is the personal website of <a href="/">xrdrsp</a>. Posts (in the form of an article, see also <a href="/archives">Archives</a>) and audios are included in the website at present. The frequency of updating is unpredictable. <font color="red">All the contents are NOT worth reading or listening to up to now.</font> In the future, a broader range of topics or forms may be involved. Some more recordings of my piano performance which I think is worth making public may in the future be uploaded here, while some details are still under consideration.</p>
        <p>Due to my English level, some of the posts may be written in Simplified Chinese or in both languages, Simplified Chinese and English. Occasionally, correctness in posts in English could be compromised, nor can clarity sometimes. Apart from these, there may exist sorts of other inaccuracies on this website, and please always feel free to report any discrepancies you come across. I also recommend that you <b>AT xrdrsp</b> when opening issues, pull requests, or discussions if possible in order to get my attention.</p>
        <!-- <p id="comment">There are two ways you can leave feedbacks: via <a href="../discuss">the Discussion Board</a> using <a href="https://cusdis.com">Cusdis</a>, and via <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> under most pages.

As for feedbacks with the commenting system <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> under some posts with an explicit theme, my only request is that the discussions keep constructive, polite, at least tangentially relevant to the topic at hand; those which are spam, off-topic, self-promoting, unfriendly, racist, extremist, pornographic, illegal, or otherwise not fulfilling the above requests shall summarily be deleted, as appropriate. Hence, the comment rating system is enabled when using <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> under posts.</p> -->

        <p>This website was set up on 31-01-2020. The present version of this website was first published on 01-11-2020. Previously, I utilized several other blog addresses with public posts, all of which are deemed expired unless specified otherwise. For the posts that have been migrated to this website, those on this website should take precedence. I also used some blogging systems, such as <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
