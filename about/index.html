        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p><font color=red><i>Attention!</i></font> Currently Valine is unexpectedly down, and thus I am working on it ... I am on the fence if I would like to no longer use Valine. Please leave your feedback. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
        This site is (shall be) hosting
            <ul>
                <li>solutions to some typical & meaningful problems;</li>
                <li>lecture notes on ordinary lessons, Mathematics & Physics & Informatics Olympiads;</li>
                <li>open problems which I find those challenging;</li>
                <li>thoughts and notes on the enrichments that I have experienced & events that I have attended, which I have considered exhilarating;</li>
                <li>various other topics, occasionally.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The topics are chosen based on my personal taste, as well as fresh things I have learnt, while the frequency of updating is unpredictable. The posts are non-technical due to my low academic levels at present.</p>
        <p>This blog is currently driven by two different comment systems, <em><a href="https://valine.js.org">Valine</a></em> and <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>. In most cases these two systems would be displayed under the posts, whereas one may not be able to be displayed in some specific areas. Comments from all people with any academic levels would be appreciated. My only request is the discussions be kept creative, constructive, polite, at least tangentially relevant to the topic at hand; those which are spam, self-promoting, off-topic, unfriendly, racist, extremist, pornographic, illegal, or otherwise not fulfilling the above requests shall summarily be deleted. Also, comments which essentially duplicate previous comments may also be deleted, or used to replace the previous comment, as appropriate. Hence, the comment rating system is enabled when using <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>, yet those ratings do not unconditionally represent the quality of the comments. I welcome you appropriately discuss, and leave suggestion and comments.</p>
        <p><i>P.S. Do not forget to <b>AT xrdrsp</b> when opening issues, pull requests, or discussions if possible in order to get my attention.</i></p>
