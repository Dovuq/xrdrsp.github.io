        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>Welcome! The frequency of updating is unpredictable. The posts are non-technical.</p>
        <p>On this website, I use the comment system, <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>. In most cases, <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em> is displayed under the pages, but meanwhile, possibly, it is disabled to be observed in some specific areas. Comments from all people with any academic levels would be appreciated. My only request is that the discussions keep creative, constructive, polite, at least tangentially relevant to the topic at hand; those which are spam, self-promoting, off-topic, unfriendly, racist, extremist, pornographic, illegal, or otherwise not fulfilling the above requests shall summarily be deleted. Comments which essentially duplicate previous comments may also be deleted or used to replace the previous comment, as appropriate. Hence, the comment rating system is enabled when using <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>, yet those ratings do not unconditionally represent the quality of the feedback. I welcome you appropriately discuss and leave suggestion and comments.</p>
        <p>There may exist sorts of inaccuracies or mistakes on this website, and thus, please always feel free to report them. I also recommend that you not forget to <b>AT xrdrsp</b> when opening issues, pull requests, or discussions if possible in order to get my attention.</p>
