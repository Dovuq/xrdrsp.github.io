        <h1><span>Chopin and Debussy’s Music</span></h1>
        This is a short piece of recording in a talent competition</i> of my school. I performed Debussy’s Berceuse héroïque, L. 132 and Chopin’s Polonaise-Fantaisie in A-Flat Major, Op. 61. The performance was recorded with poor-quality camera equipment and the audio was extracted and processed afterwards. Therefore, particularly in the recording you would hear an absurd effect of dynamics. Notably, Only ten-minute video clips are supported, resulting in a loss of music details at the moment between each two clips (specifically, at 09:07 and 19:07).
