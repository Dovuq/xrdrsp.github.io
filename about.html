        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        This site is (shall be) hosting
            <ul>
                <li>solutions to some typical & meaningful problems;</li>
                <li>lecture notes on ordinary lessons, Mathematics & Physics & Informatics Olympiads;</li>

                <li>various other topics, occasionally.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The topics are chosen based on my personal taste, as well as fresh things I have learnt, while the frequency of updating is unpredictable. The posts are non-technical due to my low academic levels at present.</p>
        <p>This blog is currently driven by two different comment systems, <em><a href="https://valine.js.org">Valine</a></em> and <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>. In most cases these two systems would be displayed under the posts, whereas one may not be able in some specific areas. Comments from all people with any academic levels would be appreciated. The discussions should be kept creative, constructive, polite, at least tangentially relevant to the topic at hand; those which are unfriendly, racist, extremist, pornographic and illegal shall evidently be deleted.</p>
        <p>Styling with 
        $\LaTeX$
        is available, and the format of the inline formulae shall be: <code>$[Your LaTeX Code]$</code> (<em>square brackets should not be included</em>); my request is to not overuse or misuse 
        $\LaTeX$
        .</p>
        <p>Comments rating systems is enabled when using <em><a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a></em>. Nonetheless, those ratings do not unconditionally represent the quality of the comments. I welcome you appropriately discuss, and leave suggestion and comments.</p>
